Welcome to the front end of my Northcoders News api.

It is built using React along with html and css and alows users to view articles by topic using different sorting criteria as well as comment and vote on specific articles

To run code on your local machine simply fork the repository and then clone using command

```
git clone https://github.com/tomgreg90/fe-nc-news.git
```

and then 

```
npm install
```

and then to run in your browser

```
npm start
```

Once the app is running in your browser you can view articles sorted by topic as well as other criteria, view comments and comment on an article yourself. You can also test the error handling capabilities by entering non existent article Id into the browser or by searching for a non-numerical Id eg.one.
