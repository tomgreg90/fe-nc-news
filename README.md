Welcome to the front end code of my Northcoders News api.

It is built using React along with html and css and alows users to view articles by topic using different sorting criteria as well as comment and vote on specific articles

To run code on your local machine simply fork the repository and then clone using command

```
git clone https://github.com/tomgreg90/fe-nc-news.git
```

and then 

```
nom install
```

and then to run in your browser

```
npm start
```
